    <h1>3 Signs Your Tarantula Is Entering Pre-Moult</h1>
    <p><strong>By 8LegLabs – Moulting Support for Tarantulas</strong></p>

    <p>Moulting is one of the most fragile moments in a tarantula's life — but the danger starts long before they flip onto their back.</p>

    <p>Knowing the early signs of pre-moult can help you adjust their care in time to prevent dehydration or stress-related complications.</p>

    <h2>1. Refusing Food</h2>
    <p>This is often the first and clearest indicator. If your tarantula starts ignoring live prey it previously hunted eagerly, pre-moult may be approaching. Don’t panic — just remove uneaten prey and observe.</p>

    <h2>2. Sluggish Movement and Hiding</h2>
    <p>Your usually active or curious tarantula may suddenly retreat into a hide or dig deep into its burrow. Their energy is now focused inward — preparing to shed their old exoskeleton.</p>

    <h2>3. A Darkening Abdomen</h2>
    <p>Especially in species with lighter abdomens, you'll notice a darker or shiny patch near the rear. This is the new exoskeleton forming underneath. In slings, this can even appear almost black.</p>

    <h2>What Should You Do?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove live feeders</li>
      <li>Keep humidity within species-appropriate range</li>
      <li>Reduce noise, vibration, and enclosure movement</li>
      <li>Ensure a clean, fresh water source</li>
    </ul>
