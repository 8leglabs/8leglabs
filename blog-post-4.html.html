    <h1>Common Moulting Myths – Busted</h1>
<p class="date">Posted: May 26, 2025</p>

<p>Tarantula moulting is already nerve-wracking — the last thing you need is misinformation. Let’s clear up some of the most common moulting myths we’ve seen floating around forums, chats, and even old-school care guides.</p>

<h2>Myth #1: “If they get stuck, just pull the skin off.”</h2>
<p>Never do this. Pulling off stuck exoskeleton can tear a soft leg or abdomen and cause serious harm. Instead, increase humidity and leave the spider alone. Only intervene in extreme cases and with proper knowledge.</p>

<h2>Myth #2: “They don’t need water if humidity is high.”</h2>
<p>False. Water dishes are essential. Hydration isn’t just about humidity — tarantulas drink, and a water dish can mean the difference between a clean moult and a fatal one.</p>

<h2>Myth #3: “A bad moult is just bad luck.”</h2>
<p>While there are always risks, good husbandry significantly reduces the chances of issues. Factors like hydration, stress, and enclosure setup make a huge difference.</p>

<h2>Myth #4: “They don’t need anything after a moult.”</h2>
<p>They do — they need peace, water, and time. Supportive care, like what’s found in MoultMend, can aid in internal recovery and stress reduction post-moult.</p>

<h2>Be Informed, Not Misled</h2>
<p>We all start somewhere. Learning to separate facts from myths is part of becoming a better keeper — and giving your spider the best possible care.</p>
