            <p>Once a year, thousands of tarantulas emerge across parts of the southwestern U.S. in search of mates. This phenomenon, nicknamed ‚ÄúTarantula Rain,‚Äù occurs mostly in late summer and early autumn.</p>
            <h2>Where and Why It Happens</h2>
            <p>It‚Äôs mostly male tarantulas making the journey. They leave their burrows to find females, often resulting in mass sightings across roads, fields, and even neighborhoods in states like Colorado, Texas, and Oklahoma.</p>
            <h2>Are They Dangerous?</h2>
            <p>Despite their size, these tarantulas are harmless to humans and avoid confrontation. It‚Äôs a fascinating and safe spectacle of nature.</p>
