    <h1>The One Thing New Keepers Often Miss</h1>
<p class="date">Posted: May 26, 2025</p>

<p>Everyone remembers their first tarantula. The excitement, the research, the frantic late-night Googling. But no matter how much you read, there’s one tiny, crucial thing that new keepers often overlook...</p>

<h2>They Forget About Hydration</h2>
<p>It sounds obvious, right? But when you’re focused on heat mats, feeding schedules, and enclosure decor, the humble water dish gets forgotten — especially for slings or arboreal species.</p>

<h2>“They get enough from misting, right?”</h2>
<p>Not exactly. Misting helps with humidity, but it doesn't always meet internal hydration needs. Tarantulas do drink, and even the tiniest ones benefit from access to a shallow water source.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters During a Moult</h2>
<p>Hydration helps maintain internal pressure, which is vital for a successful moult. A dehydrated spider can get stuck or lack the strength to complete the process — something no new keeper wants to experience.</p>

<h2>How to Fix It</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always provide a clean, shallow water dish</li>
  <li>Use a bottle cap for slings or small juveniles</li>
  <li>Don’t rely on misting alone</li>
</ul>

<h2>MoultMend for Extra Peace of Mind</h2>
<p>If you're new and nervous, MoultMend adds another layer of support. It’s designed to complement good husbandry with added hydration and stress-reducing botanicals.</p>
