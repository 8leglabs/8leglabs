            <p>Many viral images show brightly glowing spiders ‚Äî but are they real? Some spiders do fluoresce under UV light, but none are truly bioluminescent like fireflies.</p>
            <h2>Fluorescence vs. Bioluminescence</h2>
            <p>Fluorescence means the spider reflects UV light back as visible colour. Bioluminescence means it creates its own light. No spider has been shown to do the latter naturally.</p>
            <h2>Which Spiders Glow?</h2>
            <p>Jumping spiders, some orb weavers, and others in tropical regions have shown fluorescent properties under black light ‚Äî but it‚Äôs rarely visible to the naked eye.</p>
