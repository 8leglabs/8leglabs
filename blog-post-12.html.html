    <h1>5 Signs Your Tarantula Had a Successful Moult</h1>
<p class="date">Posted: May 26, 2025</p>

<p>The moult is over, the drama has passed — now what? Here are five signs that your tarantula pulled off a clean, healthy moult and is well on the road to recovery.</p>

<h2>1. The Old Exoskeleton Is Fully Intact</h2>
<p>One of the easiest signs is spotting a complete shed — including all legs, fangs, and abdomen casing. A messy or torn moult might indicate complications.</p>

<h2>2. Your Tarantula Is Upright and Calm</h2>
<p>Within a few hours to a day, your tarantula should right itself and remain still. That’s a good sign it made it through the hard part and is resting.</p>

<h2>3. No Leaks or Strange Movements</h2>
<p>There shouldn’t be any fluid oozing from joints or limbs. Wobbly walking is normal for a few days — but dragging legs, twitching, or curling under may signal a problem.</p>

<h2>4. Bright, Fresh Colouration</h2>
<p>That “new spider” glow is real. Tarantulas often appear more vibrant, velvety, or glossy after a successful moult.</p>

<h2>5. Appetite Returns (Eventually)</h2>
<p>Don’t rush the first feeding — but when your tarantula finally takes food again, that’s a surefire sign the moult was a success. Wait 7–10 days before offering prey, depending on size.</p>

<h2>Bonus Tip:</h2>
<p>If your spider had a rough moult in the past, now is the perfect time to begin offering support before the next one. MoultMend was developed to aid hydration and reduce stress in these key moments.</p>
