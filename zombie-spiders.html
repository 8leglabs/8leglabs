            <p>A certain parasitic fungus ‚Äî most notably from the genus <em>Cordyceps</em> ‚Äî can infect spiders and take control of their central nervous system. Once infected, the fungus compels the spider to leave its safe shelter and climb to an elevated, exposed location. There, the fungus consumes the spider from the inside and erupts from its body, spreading spores to infect others.</p>
            <h2>The Science of Zombification</h2>
            <p>This real-life mind control isn't just the stuff of sci-fi. While <em>Cordyceps</em> is better known for attacking ants, similar fungal species affect spiders too ‚Äî especially in humid jungle environments.</p>
            <h2>Why It Captures the Imagination</h2>
            <p>It‚Äôs creepy, it‚Äôs real, and scientists are studying it for both biology and potential medical applications.</p>
