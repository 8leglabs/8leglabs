    <h1>Spider Silk in Space: NASA’s Strange Experiments</h1>
    <p><strong>What do spiders do in zero gravity? NASA wanted to find out — so they sent some into orbit.</strong></p>
    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>In 1973, NASA’s Skylab hosted two garden spiders, Arabella and Anita, to study how they spin webs in microgravity. The results? Their webs were sloppier and less symmetrical than those spun on Earth — at least at first.</p>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Spider silk is stronger than steel by weight and incredibly elastic. Understanding how gravity affects its structure could lead to new materials or production methods. Scientists hope space-grown silk could one day be used in medicine, construction, or even bulletproof fabric.</p>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>After adjusting to their new environment, the spiders started spinning more normal-looking webs — proving that even arachnids can adapt to life off-planet.</p>
