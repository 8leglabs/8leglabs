    <h1>How We Lost a Tarantula to a Bad Moult</h1>
    <p><strong>By 8LegLabs – Moulting Support for Tarantulas</strong></p>

    <p>She was a juvenile curly hair — healthy, active, and full of personality. She’d taken down every meal and never missed a moult before. Then one day, she stopped eating. We assumed it was the usual pre-moult behaviour.</p>

    <p>We didn’t change anything. No extra hydration. No adjustments to humidity. We just waited.</p>

    <h2>What Went Wrong?</h2>
    <p>She flipped onto her back late one night. We were relieved — she was moulting! We kept an eye on her, kept quiet, and let nature take its course. But by morning, something felt wrong. She hadn’t moved.</p>

    <p>We waited another hour. Then two. We could see parts of the exoskeleton still attached. Her legs were twitching. She was stuck.</p>

    <p>We tried to help. Soft misting. Tweezers. Warmth. But it was too late. She passed shortly after.</p>

    <h2>The Realisation</h2>
    <p>We’d made the classic mistake: we waited and assumed nature would handle it — and we missed our window to prepare her.</p>

    <p>We had no idea how much her hydration, immune balance, and environment could’ve changed the outcome. And once we saw how common this story was among other keepers... we knew we had to do something.</p>

    <div class="cta">
      <p><strong>That’s why we created MoultMend</strong> — a pre and post-moult supplement designed to help tarantulas hydrate, balance, and recover during their most vulnerable time.</p>
